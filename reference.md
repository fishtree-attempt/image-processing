## Glossary

{:auto_ids}

adaptive thresholding
:   

additive color model
:   a color model that predicts the appearance of colors by summing the numeric representations of the component colors

bacterial colony
:   a visible cluster of bacteria growing on the surface of or within a solid medium, presumably cultured from a single cell

binary image
:   a digital image that has only two possible values for each pixel. Typically, the two colors used for a binary image are black and white.

Gaussian blur
:   a widely used effect in graphics software, typically to reduce image noise and reduce detail

BMP (bitmap image file)
:  a raster graphics image file format used to store bitmap digital images, independently of the display device 

bounding box
:   the smallest enclosing box for a set of points

colorimetrics
:   the science of describing human color perception

channel
:  the grayscale representation of a primary color in a digital image 

contour
:   

child (in contours)
:   

crop
:  the removal of unwanted outer areas from an image 

color histogram
:  a representation of the number of pixels that have colors in each of a fixed list of color ranges

edge detection
:   a variety of mathematical methods that aim at identifying points in a digital image at which the image brightness changes sharply 

fixed-level thresholding
:   

grayscale
:   an image in which the value of each pixel is a single value representing only the amount of light (or intensity) of that pixel

image segmentation
:   the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments to make the image more meaningful and easier to analyze

intensity
:   

JPEG
:  a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography 

kernel
:   a small matrix. It is used for blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection, and more

left-hand coordinate system
:   

lossy compression
:   a class of data encoding methods that uses inexact approximations and partial data discarding to represent the content

lossless compression
:  a class of data compression algorithms that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data 

maize
:   also known as corn

mask
:   applied to digital images to "cut-out" the background or other unwanted features

morphometrics
:   the quantitative analysis of form, a concept that encompasses size and shape

noise
:   random variation of brightness or color information in images. An undesirable by-product of image capture that obscures the desired information.

parent (in contours)
:   

raster graphics
:   a dot matrix data structure that represents a generally rectangular grid of pixels

RGB color model
:   an additive color model in which red, green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue.

root (in contours)
:   

thresholding
:   the simplest method of image segmentation. From a grayscale image, thresholding can be used to create binary images

TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)
:   a computer file format for storing raster graphics images; also 
    abbreviated TIF

titration
:  a common laboratory method of quantitative chemical analysis to determine the concentration of an identified analyte (a substance to be analyzed)
