## Setup instructions for the Image Processing workshop

1. Download and install the latest [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for your operating system.
   Make sure to choose the Python 3 version (as opposed to the one with Python 2).

2. All code and example image files are contained within the [`code`](https://github.com/datacarpentry/image-processing/tree/gh-pages/code) folder of this repository.  Learners can clone the repo or download the full repo zip file to their local computers and access the files that way, or instructors may choose to provide a zip file of just the `code` folder.
